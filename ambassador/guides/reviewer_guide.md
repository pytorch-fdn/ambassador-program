# 👥 Reviewer Guide: PyTorch Ambassador Program

Welcome — and thank you for supporting the review process for the **PyTorch Ambassador Program**! 🎉  
This guide walks you through how to evaluate nominations using our score-based system and help nominees receive thoughtful, consistent feedback.

---

## 📌 Your Role as a Reviewer

As a reviewer, your job is to:

1. Identify active nominations
2. Review the nominee's contributions and impact
3. Submit a score from **1 to 5** with a short explanation
4. Allow the system to calculate the average and apply a final outcome

---

## 🔍 Step 1: Find Nominations

Visit the GitHub issues page:  
👉 [View all nominations](https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/ambassador-program/issues)

Look for issues labeled:

- `nomination`
- `under-review`
- `scoring-in-progress`
- `ambassador`

These indicate the submission is ready for review and scoring.

---

## 📝 Step 2: Evaluate the Nominee

Carefully read the nomination issue. Consider:

- The nominee’s contributions to PyTorch or its ecosystem
- Community engagement (e.g., events, mentorship, education)
- Future goals and plans as an ambassador
- Any linked profiles or supporting materials

---

## 🧮 Step 3: Submit Your Score with a Short Explanation

Comment directly on the issue using the format:

Score: X
<brief explanation>

Where `X` is your score between **1 and 5**, based on the nominee’s impact and readiness.

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Not ready for the program |
| 2 | Below expectations |
| 3 | Meets expectations |
| 4 | Strong candidate |
| 5 | Exceptional — ideal ambassador

**✅ Every score should be accompanied by a short explanation.**  
This ensures the nominee receives fair, transparent feedback.

---

### ✅ Example of a Good Score Comment

Score: 4
The nominee has made solid contributions to PyTorch tutorials and hosted multiple community events. They are active in forums and have helped onboard new contributors. Would love to see more long-term planning around ambassador goals.

---

### ❌ What Not to Do

- Don't comment without the `Score: X` format
- Don’t submit multiple scores — only the first is counted
- Don’t score without a reason

## ⚙️ Step 4: What Happens Next

Once all reviewers have submitted their scores, the scoring automation will be triggered to calculate the final decision.

The system:

1. Collects the **first valid score** per reviewer
2. Calculates the **average score**
3. Applies the result:

| Average Score | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| ≥ 3.0 | ✅ `approved` |
| < 3.0 | ❌ `rejected` (and closed) |

4. Adds the `scoring-complete` label
5. Removes temporary labels (`under-review`, `scoring-in-progress`)
6. Posts a summary comment listing:
   - Reviewer usernames
   - Average score
   - Final outcome

📝 The system does **not use the explanation in the calculation**, but nominees will see your comments — so thoughtful feedback matters.

---

## ✅ After the Final Score

- **Approved nominations** are marked `approved`, and onboarding begins
- **Rejected nominations** are marked `rejected` and closed

---

## 💬 Frequently Asked Questions

### 🔁 What if someone submits a nomination twice?

The program manager will merge or close duplicates. Only review the nomination labeled `under-review`.

---

### 👤 Can I review anonymously?

No — scores must be posted from your GitHub account. If privacy is important, coordinate with the committee and have a representative submit on behalf of the group.

---

### 🤝 Can I coordinate with other reviewers?

Yes — please do!  
We encourage you to:
- Discuss nominees as a group before scoring
- Share context, questions, or doubts in the issue thread or offline
- Align on how you interpret each score range
