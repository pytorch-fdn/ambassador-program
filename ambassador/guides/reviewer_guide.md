## üß≠ Purpose of the Review Process

The PyTorch Ambassador Program aims to recognize individuals who:
- Contribute meaningfully to the PyTorch ecosystem
- Support open-source and community-first development
- Engage in education, advocacy, or leadership around PyTorch

Reviewers evaluate nominations to help select ambassadors who align with this mission.

Reviewers assess nominees based on:

- **Technical expertise** with PyTorch and its ecosystem
- **Community engagement** through events, education, mentoring, or organizing
- **Thought leadership** via writing, talks, research, or advocacy
- **Alignment with PyTorch Foundation values** (inclusion, responsible AI, open collaboration)
- **Credibility and references**

Each cycle provides a rubric or form to guide evaluations.
