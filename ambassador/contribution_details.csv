273,"Note: I previously submitted an incomplete version (now closed)—please consider this as my final and complete application. For better readability, you may paste it into a text editor.


1. Knowledge-Sharing & Content Creation
As an ambassador, I’ll continue the PyTorch education work I began in 2020. On YouTube, I break down PyTorch’s neural network modules using pen and paper, walking through them step by step. My goal is to help researchers and beginners understand both the intuition and mechanics behind common layers and architectures.

I aim for each PyTorch module to have a corresponding video that is simple to understand. This project is still ongoing, and I’ve already covered most major modules, including those used in generative models. My next focus will be on PyTorch’s reinforcement learning modules. 

2. Increasing Access to ML Education Through PyTorch
I want to help students see how the math they learn in school connects to machine learning and eventually to real-world applications.
For example, torch.nn.Linear is the foundation of many important components in architectures like transformers. Exploring how the Linear Layer works can inspire ideas for more efficient or lightweight alternatives. That kind of curiosity and experimentation is exactly what PyTorch enables.
To support this, I plan to collaborate with schools, tech hubs, and learning communities to deliver beginner-friendly lectures and hands-on workshops. These sessions will introduce PyTorch from the ground up with no prior programming or ML experience required.



3. Hosting Workshops & Events
While my outreach in schools focuses on foundational exposure, I also plan to run more structured workshops for learners looking to deepen their understanding of PyTorch and ML., 
I’ll organize both online and in-person events, depending on the needs of each community. These workshops will be:
• Topic-specific, focused on deep dives into key PyTorch and ML concepts—for example:
o   Selecting a layer from PyTorch’s documentation and walking through how it works in detail
• Project-based and interactive, helping participants gain hands-on experience through guided coding exercises
• Open to all, but particularly valuable for those who already have basic familiarity with Python or ML and want to grow their skills
The goal is to bridge the gap between beginner knowledge and real-world ML application by showing how concepts translate into working models using PyTorch.

Many software developers today use generative models like those from OpenAI without fully understanding the underlying technology. My workshops will also target these developers by offering them a clearer view of how the tools they use actually work under the hood.
 
4. Mobile App for Learning PyTorch
I believe large language models can help us build powerful learning tools more efficiently than ever. In addition to my upcoming mobile app Berry, which focuses on health management, I plan to develop a mobile companion app for learning PyTorch. The app will feature
• Interactive flashcards on PyTorch modules
• Code examples and model visualizations
• Quick daily challenges like “build a model in 5 minutes”


This will help make PyTorch education more fun and accessible—right from a phone. It could also be useful for children using iPads, essentially exposing them to PyTorch at an even earlier stage.
 
5. Contribution to the PyTorch Ecosystem
While education is my strongest area, I also plan to contribute directly to the PyTorch ecosystem by:
• Submitting PRs for small bug fixes or documentation improvements on GitHub
• Extending PyTorch tutorials, especially in reinforcement learning, based on what I’m building and teaching.","- PyTorch YouTube Channel : https://www.youtube.com/@machinelearningwithpytorch/featured

246,To improve myself and learn more and support my community to use PyTorch in their projects and as a AWS Community Builder and Google Expert I have my community and need to support them with latest updates,
245,"My name is Lucas Braz and I’m the nominee. As a content creator and founder of Legacy GG, a Latin American community of gamers and Web3 builders, I see the PyTorch Ambassador Program as a great opportunity to bring more visibility and education around AI to our region.

I plan to contribute mainly through written content and tutorial videos that help onboard new users into the PyTorch ecosystem, especially those coming from Web3 and creator backgrounds. I create educational threads, onboarding guides, and short videos aimed at simplifying complex ideas for beginners.

I also intend to organize online events and learning sessions with LATAM communities where I already have strong connections thanks to my leadership at Legacy GG. These would be opportunities to introduce PyTorch resources, share updates, and connect people interested in building with AI.

My goal is to help more people in Latin America understand and explore PyTorch—through clear, localized content and community-driven engagement.",

5. Advocacy & Feedback Loop: Serve as a bridge between PyTorch users and the core team—gathering feedback, sharing insights from real-world use, and helping shape the direction of the framework.",
242,"I'd be happy to engage with the PyTorch community primarily by being a speaker at different events, sharing insights and experiences to inspire and educate others. I am open to co-hosting PyTorch meetups or workshops or creating tutorials or blog posts.","I have authored a Pytorch library called TorchEBM for modeling and training energy-based and diffusion models. Additionally, I have authored blog posts and Colabs notebooks, all available on my website. 

Currently, I'm developing a CUDA-accelerated library for randomized BLAS, which eventually may qualify to be integrated into Pytorch after reaching an appropriate stage.

241,"I am an active contributor to Pytorch Repositories (specifically core pytorch and torchtune) and I aim to continue doing so. Resolving issues and submitting PRs has made me understand pytorch repositories better and I want to learn what PyTorch actually does under its hood, which will help me write in-depth technical content as I learn. I've previously created technical content (tutorials and example notebooks) for IOOS (under Google Summer of Code) and I will create content for Pytorch as well (blogs, tweets, tutorials and examples).  

Another thing that I have in mind is - A GitHub repo (and a series of blogs/tweets) called `PyTorch-Visual` visualizing how basic methods like `squeeze`, `permute`, `view`, `reshape`, etc work. This is a basic but fundamental thing that most people overlook while writing code (including me). Think of it as an illustrated guide to the working of PyTorch.  

I am a member of my college's open-source club and I give talks about contributing to open-source in general. The club regularly conducts sessions on technologies like FastAPI, Pandas, etc and I want to start an introductory series `Getting Started with PyTorch` or `PyTorch is all you need` (LOL) to help juniors learn (and maybe contribute to) PyTorch.  

I've also worked on implementing various research papers in PyTorch and converting TF/Keras codes to PyTorch and I aim to do this for new paper releases as well(in case they haven't open-sourced their code). Few of my paper implementations - https://github.com/omkar-334/agri-ml, https://github.com/omkar-334/HateMM-benchmarks  

Back when I was in first year of college, I had come across the Tensorflow User Group of my city (Hyderabad) and I wondered why isn't there a PyTorch User Group... I want to organize meetups in Hyderabad for PyTorch enthusiasts and contributors (baby steps), then maybe set up a PyTorch User Group. (maybe one dayPyTorch Conference can be hosted in India!!)","I was a contributor at Google Summer of Code last year, which enhanced my interests in contributing to OpenSource. Since then I've contributed to various repos like Runpod, Keras, DataFormer, Pytorch, etc.  

I was an intern at Indian Institute of Technology, Indore, where I had performed research on multimodal hate-speech detection. Our model and the baseline comparison models were implemented in pytorch by me, and the research paper has been accepted to the ACL 2025 Main conference. Most/All of my AI-ML work is done using PyTorch (very grateful for it).  
I am currently a research intern at Indian Institute of Science, working on time series forecasting and guess what, All of it still involves PyTorch, which only proves the fact that PyTorch is used in all fields of AI/ML.  
As Yann LeCun said (https://x.com/hardmaru/status/1929363747568762892), The AI industry as you see it now wouldn't have existed without PyTorch.  
Thank you!"

I plan to organize regular workshops and meetups—both virtual and in-person—where community members can collaborate, share experiences, and learn about the latest developments in PyTorch. These events would include hands-on coding sessions, guest speakers from industry and academia, and open Q&A forums to address members' challenges.

Mentoring is a key aspect of my vision. I intend to launch a mentorship program that pairs experienced users with newcomers, providing guidance on both technical topics and career development. I will also be available on community channels (such as forums, Discord, and GitHub) to answer questions and support open-source contributions, encouraging more users to get involved.

For knowledge-sharing, I plan to write detailed tutorials, host webinars, and contribute to the PyTorch documentation. By highlighting community projects and success stories, I hope to inspire others and showcase the diverse ways PyTorch can be used.

Ultimately, my goal is to foster an inclusive, supportive, and innovative community where knowledge is freely exchanged and everyone feels empowered to contribute.",
239,"I’m currently a third-year undergraduate student and an active mentor at my university’s AIML club, where I regularly help organize and lead workshops, hackathons, and learning sessions focused on AI/ML. Many of these sessions are designed to introduce students to core machine learning concepts using PyTorch, which I’ve found to be both beginner-friendly and powerful for real-world applications.

As a PyTorch Ambassador, I would continue expanding these efforts by hosting more hands-on events, both online and on campus, to make deep learning more accessible to students and early-career developers. I also use PyTorch extensively in my current internship, where I work on deep learning models, giving me practical industry experience that I can bring back to the community through tutorials, code walkthroughs, and mentoring.

I’m particularly passionate about helping others get started with PyTorch—from explaining the basics to walking through advanced projects—and I believe consistent peer-to-peer learning can make a big impact.

194,"0. Throughout my career — from building robotic perception systems at Dyson to optimising cloud and edge inference at Arm — I’ve seen firsthand how powerful PyTorch is when applied in the real world. But I’ve also seen how inaccessible AI can feel to students, early-career engineers, and people from underrepresented backgrounds who don’t have the same starting points or support.

1. As a PyTorch Ambassador, my goal is to break those barriers — to make AI more accessible and inclusive, not just for professionals, but for students, beginners, and underrepresented groups. I want to help bridge the gap between curiosity and capability, especially in communities where exposure to AI is limited.

2. To do that, I plan to organise outreach programs with schools and universities — particularly in areas where AI education is lacking. These sessions will be practical, hands-on, and built around showing students that AI isn’t just for researchers — it’s for them too. I’ll use PyTorch as the gateway, helping them build small but meaningful projects they can be proud of.

3. I’m also committed to supporting women in tech and other underrepresented groups through mentorship, community building, and inclusive events. In my current and past roles, I’ve mentored junior engineers (including women starting out in AI), run internal training sessions, and helped early-career team members ship their first PyTorch models into production.

4. Beyond that, I’ll keep contributing as a technical educator. I’ve deployed PyTorch models in production at Dyson (robotic stain detection, segmentation, depth estimation) and at Arm (quantization, compiler integration, benchmarking). I plan to share that experience through open-source examples, blog posts, workshops, and real-world case studies focused on deployment, not just prototyping.

5. This mix of technical experience, mentorship, and a clear passion for outreach means I’m ready to help build a PyTorch community that is not only capable, but diverse and inclusive. One that reflects the real world — and builds for it too.","You can check out some of my work on GitHub.com/usamahz, especially around ML systems, robotics, and deployment workflows. I’ve worked at Dyson Robotics on real-time edge perception systems and now at Arm, where I focus on PyTorch models for Arm CPUs and NPUs along with other frameworks such as OneDNN, plus more.

I’ve mentored over 10 engineers and interns, ran internal training sessions, and built ML tooling used across teams. I believe AI should be usable, teachable, and welcoming — and I’d bring that mindset to everything I do as a PyTorch Ambassador in the United Kingdom!

153,"Eikan is PyTorch TAC member and has played a critical role in enhancing the C++/OpenMP backend for TorchInductor, delivering significant performance improvements for key models and benchmarks. He designed a new pluggable backend registration mechanism that simplifies the process for new hardware integration. Additionally, he contributed to ""Eager through torch.compile,"" enabling automatic kernel generation for ATen operations, and extended support for Intel GPUs within Inductor using Triton. 
In addition, Eikan has been a key contributor to Intel GPU integration, defining its roadmap and aligning it with PyTorch's design philosophy. As the lead architect, he has been deeply involved in all Intel GPU components, including runtime, eager mode, and torch.compile, and has reviewed almost all Intel GPU-related PRs. Eikan’s work extends beyond Intel GPU, contributing to the generalization of the PyTorch runtime for broader accelerator support and working on making PyTorch’s distributed framework device-neutral. 
Torch.compile
• C++/OpenMP Backend: Eikan collaborated closely with Jason(@jansel), Bin(@desertfire), and Horace(@Chillee) to design and implement the C++/OpenMP backend of Inductor. One of his notable achievements was optimizing the TorchInductor C++/OpenMP backend, resulting in a significant improvement in the performance of the HF model from 0.97x to 1.2x prior to the first torch.compile announcement in PT 2.0. Eikan’s enabling work was featured in Jason’s presentation at the PyTorch Conference 2022. After the PT 2.0 announcement, Eikan continued to work with community contributors to enhance the Dynamo benchmarks through vectorization and further maturation of the C++/OpenMP backend - CPU backend performance update and deep dive on key optimizations
    - Single-Socket Multi-threads, torchbench: 1.39x, huggingface: 1.20x, timm_models: 1.73x
    - Single-core Single-thread, torchbench: 1.29x, huggingface: 1.15x, timm_models: 1.37x.
• Pluggable Inductor Backend: Eikan designed and implemented a new mechanism for registering hardware backends within Inductor (RFC). This mechanism allows new hardware to register its backend-specific implementation at runtime, leveraging the fusion capabilities and optimizations of Inductor to simplify the process of supporting new devices. Compared to the Dynamo backend approach, this greatly reduces design and implementation complexity. The main focus for a new backend is on generating optimal code for specific devices. Eikan introduced this feature as a poster at the PyTorch Conference 2024.
    - Inductor Backend Registration APIs: register_backend_for_device, get_scheduling_for_device, get_wrapper_codegen_for_device
    - AOTInductor Registration APIs: RegisterAOTIModelRunner,  getAOTIModelRunnerRegistry
• Eager Through torch.compile: This approach aims to automatically generate kernels for ATen operations using torch.compile, removing the need for backend-specific implementations for each operation. Eikan collaborated closely with Jason and Bin to finalize the design(RFC) and implement the static shape functionalities. For PyTorch 2.5, the registration API(_impl_with_aoti_compile) will be exposed to users for new hardware backend eager mode support. Eikan introduced the feature as a poster at the PyTorch conference 2024.
• Intel GPU Backend: Eikan successfully extended Inductor to support Intel GPUs on top of Triton, enhancing and democratizing the PyTorch hardware ecosystem. With this support, PyTorch on Intel GPUs demonstrates promising performance and an improved out-of-the-box experience, significantly broadening PyTorch's applicability. Eikan has been actively involved in the Triton community, initiating support for Intel GPUs in Triton. His contributions laid a strong foundation for the Intel GPU backend within Inductor, and he enabled the Intel GPU backend by reusing much of the design and implementation of the existing Triton backend. Additionally, Eikan led efforts to generalize GPU accelerator support in Inductor by designing the DeviceInterface for GPU accelerators, which serves as a preliminary step towards a more generalized accelerator runtime in PyTorch. He delivered a presentation on the Intel GPU backend at the PyTorch Conference 2023.

Intel GPU
Eikan has played a pivotal role in Intel GPU integration, contributing to its design, development, and integration within the PyTorch ecosystem.
As the lead architect, Eikan has been instrumental in defining the roadmap for Intel GPU integration and aligning it with PyTorch's overall vision. He has actively participated in discussions about integration strategies and has been deeply involved in every aspect of the Intel GPU components, such as eager mode, torch.compile, runtime, profiler, CI/CD, and more. Eikan has reviewed almost all Intel GPU-related PRs, ensuring that all contributions are aligned with PyTorch’s design philosophy, as outlined in the Intel GPU Enabling Status and Feature Plan. 
Beyond Intel GPU-specific efforts, Eikan has been proactive in generalizing the Intel GPU runtime. He has closely collaborated with Alban@alband), Guanye(@guangyey) to generalize the PyTorch runtime for various accelerators. This effort not only facilitates PyTorch's deployment on a wide range of hardware but also simplifies the integration process for different hardware backends.
Additionally, Eikan is working on generalizing PyTorch’s distributed framework to support a variety of distributed backends. The goal is to make PyTorch distributed device-neutral, thereby reducing the effort required to integrate new hardware. Regarding Intel GPU distributed support, Eikan leads the team in adopting a ""generalize-first"" approach before integrating the Intel GPU distributed backend.
Eikan presented on Intel GPU integration at the PyTorch Conference 2024, where he shared insights on the progress and future plans for Intel GPU support within PyTorch.",

133,"As the President of the Google Developer Groups on Campus (GDGC) at Middle East Technical University (METU), I am currently leading one of the most active and technically capable student communities in Turkey. METU is widely recognized as the country’s top engineering university, and our community runs the largest AI education and project series in the institution.

In the past year, I designed and led a 7-week Deep Learning training program that certified 122 students. The entire series was designed to be beginner-friendly yet technically rigorous. I now plan to evolve this program into a PyTorch-centered curriculum—where students not only learn deep learning concepts but also develop real-world projects using PyTorch. This updated curriculum will target even more students across multiple universities, and will emphasize reproducibility, open source collaboration, and community contribution. All educational content, including lecture slides, coding notebooks, and assignments, is prepared in English to ensure accessibility beyond local boundaries and allow scaling internationally.

In addition to educational efforts, I am directly involved in PyTorch-based research and applied AI projects. At ROMER (the Center for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at METU), I work as an undergraduate researcher, developing transformation-invariant encoders for point cloud data using PyTorch and PyTorch3D. Our focus is on creating robust representations for 3D data that can resist geometric transformations and noise, contributing to the academic understanding and real-world application of neural representations.

Furthermore, as part of my student community and personal projects, I have led or contributed to several applied AI initiatives, including:

1- Hector-Metubot: A campus-wide chatbot using RAG.

98,"As someone who has organized cohorts on PyTorch centric usecases in Cohere for AI for 1.5 years, I've come to realize that teaching how to use something promotes projects with great potential but if you tell some how that something works you are building a community of contributors then.

Pytorch is a great frameworks and part of the reason is that we have ""enough"" level of control. However, the core components that power it are usually behind the scenes and often seen as ""exotic"". I love to to make these  more accessible and normal to the user.

To be more concrete, I would love to conduct project sprints and develop content that demystifies these concepts in a more grounded approach i.e. if you were to discover this thing from nowhere how would you do it? The more approachable a code-base seems the more comfortable new contributors will feel.

Logistics wise, I can organize learning groups at Stanford too, we have a big userbase of PyTorch users here!","I've been writing blogs and conducting educational cohorts for ~5 years now. It was in 2020 that I along with some passionate folks started ""Build With Us"" Cohorts at Crework. Here we chose a small set of peers divide them into teams and helped them build real-world products rather than simple PoC projects. We had weekly reading and implementation sessions on various topics revolving around various topics but implementations centering around PyTorch.

In 2023, I started a channel ""Beginners in Research Driven Studies""(BIRDS) at Cohere for AI, along with my 2 co-leads where we helped beginners to understand the process of research. Over the period of my time there we offered 3 programs:

1. Mini Sprints: We choose a Paper to read and in week 1. We choose a lead to run the sprint who would explain the project from first principle and explain the paper. In week 2, that person would show case the implementation of the project which would be in PyTorch. In week 3 we had a guest speaker(usually the author of the paper) and in final week we showcased implementations of people in the community.
2. Nidification: These we one-shot sessions centering around explanation of niched concepts.
3. Mini Cohorts: This was an 8 week event with a more zero-to-hero agenda. I'll give the example of CUDA Cohort that I lead while I was there. We started by creating a syllabus for the 8 weeks without assumptions or pre-requisites along with weekly assignments for practice. Each week, we would give a session in a lite lecture type setting explaining concepts like GPU internals, C/C++, Working of various CPU components, Parallel Programming, PyTorch Internals, CUDA C, etc. Last 2-3 weeks, we would have a capstone projects that people would make. In our first cohort we had a registration of more than 150 people and many of them had really great Ideas to work on.

I love communities and building them, they are not just a learning opportunity but a group a people with same goal. That is a motivation in itself, talking to people smarter than me is a privilege that becomes more accessible in communities.

In addition to events, I love sharing knowledge and would be eager to mentor others, especially students and early career researchers. I have picked up a number of practical insights and techniques through hands on experimentation with PyTorch, and I’m excited to teach others and foster a supportive learning environment. By creating more spaces for collaboration and knowledge sharing, I hope to help the PyTorch initiative thrive and inspire others to contribute to its open-source ecosystem.",wajahat-alikhan.github.io
