I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in machine learning and a strong academic background in AI and computer vision. As AI Tech Lead at Awana, I mentor a team that delivers ML solutions for U.S.-based clients while also leading the AI Skills Accelerator, a program I designed to empower Latin American developers with practical, end-to-end ML training.
I have strong expertise in PyTorch for deep learning, computer vision, and geospatial AI. At Awana, I lead and teach modules on Deep Learning, Foundation Models, and Generative AI, all built using PyTorch as the core framework. I’ve worked on real-world projects that apply PyTorch to tasks such as satellite imagery analysis using TorchGeo, transfer learning, and model optimization for production.
My teaching efforts through the AI Skills Accelerator have helped  Latin American developers gain practical experience with PyTorch. I’m deeply passionate about making advanced AI education accessible, especially for underrepresented groups, and PyTorch plays a central role in that mission.

As the Gitkraken Ambassador, only AWS cloud club captain, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador and Co-organizer of Machine Learning, AI, NLP and Deep Learing Community Bangladesh (previously TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh part of Google AI Community), Azure Tech Group Bangladesh, Fabric User Community Bangladesh, The AI, ML Community(part of Global AI Community)  When I started community work I saw so many students get enthusiasm when I share them the oppotunities I got from program but many students are not wiling to work for it due to their academics pressure.  So I was the only person here who had to step up and don't give up on this community building process and I did that and grew over 50,000 members on different facebook tech communities sharing opporunities and growth to them: https://www.facebook.com/azaynul123/ When I joined the Google AI community group TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh as organizer there weren't so much activity but after joining this community we were able to win grandmaster award 2 times and it was first time for Bangladeshi community to have taken 92+ events in a single year. We also organized ML Olympiad 2023, 2024 , Keras Community Day 2023 physically in Brac University, 3 of our community members also won global awards from google for taking highest events: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zaynul-abedin-miah_vertexai-google-machinelearning-activity-7292131729782280192-8rRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACJvR6sBLMfFJjZ96ahnmku97wrMGgU6eIM .

Yo, the nominee is no stranger to hustle and leadership! They rocked it as an Unstop Ambassador, where they turned networking into an art form, and slayed as the Machine Learning Co-Lead at GDG, running squads and leveling up the ML game for the community. They didn’t stop there—picked as a DEV3PACK Fellow and an ML Fellow at Fellowship.ai, proving they don’t just talk AI, they live and breathe it. Plus, they’ve crushed multiple internships, stacking real-world experience like boss moves in their coding playbook. With this mix of street cred and deep tech chops, they’re ready to blaze trails as a PyTorch Ambassador, bringing the vibes, the skills, and the mad passion to keep the community lit and learning nonstop.

As a PyTorch Ambassador, I would actively promote the adoption and effective use of PyTorch within my academic, professional, and online communities. Drawing from my background as a university lecturer and content creator, I would contribute in the following ways:
	1.	Community Education and Engagement
I plan to organize regular workshops, webinars, and hands-on labs on PyTorch fundamentals, deep learning, and generative AI applications. These events will be tailored for students, researchers, and developers, especially in underrepresented regions like East Africa, to help them build practical skills using PyTorch.
	2.	Content Creation and Localization
I will create high-quality educational content—tutorials, videos, blog posts, and code walkthroughs—focusing on real-world use cases of PyTorch. Where relevant, I’ll localize this content into regional languages to broaden accessibility and engagement.
	3.	Mentorship and Collaboration
I will mentor aspiring ML practitioners through bootcamps and open-source contribution initiatives, encouraging them to use and contribute to the PyTorch ecosystem. I’ll also foster collaborations between academia and industry by showcasing PyTorch-powered projects and research.
	4.	Advocacy and Representation
I will represent PyTorch at conferences, AI community meetups, and educational panels, advocating for ethical, inclusive, and impactful AI development using PyTorch. I’m committed to bridging the knowledge gap in AI education and showcasing PyTorch as a powerful and approachable framework for learners at all levels.",https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/ambassador-program/issues/219

I’ve been actively driving AMD’s AI software ecosystem by building open-source community collaborations with vLLM, SGLang, Unsloth, and OpenManus—especially in the context of open-source AI and inference optimization. I’ve initiated developer-facing programs such as GPU contests, hackathons, and technical blog series to deepen engagement and showcase AMD’s leadership in AI acceleration. These efforts reflect my commitment to empowering developers and advancing open innovation across the region. With above, I hope to work more on the PyTorch community. As an existing member of Linux Foundation, AMD is moving forward delivering more on open source AI. This will be the right time to show how AMD technology helps changing this world with its powerful chips, processors and most importantly software ecosystem.

I am currently in the process of joining the NVIDIA University Ambassador Program, which I see as a strong complement to the PyTorch Ambassador role. Together, these programs would position me to deliver high-impact training on how to effectively use PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs—particularly for large-scale deep learning applications such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. Additionally, as a certified Instructor with The Carpentries, I have the ability to teach these topics to a global audience through workshops and academic courses. This combination of technical expertise, outreach platforms, and pedagogical training would enable me to promote PyTorch in a variety of educational and research settings, both locally and internationally.

In addition to my teaching and community involvement, I actively conduct research using PyTorch. Most recently, I submitted a research paper addressing bias and fairness challenges in federated learning, specifically applied to the healthcare sector. The work leverages PyTorch to implement distributed model training with fairness-aware optimization strategies, showcasing how the framework can be used to tackle critical real-world issues in sensitive domains like healthcare. This further reflects my commitment to applying PyTorch not just for performance, but also for ethical and responsible AI.

While I am not yet a PyTorch expert or an active contributor to the framework, I see this opportunity as a powerful step forward, not just for me, but for my entire community. In many parts of Nigeria and across Africa, access to hands-on support and mentorship in artificial intelligence and machine learning is still very limited. I want to change that.
Becoming a PyTorch Ambassador would give me the chance to learn more deeply, grow my skills, and bring that knowledge home in ways that make a real difference. I want to be the person who sparks that first “aha” moment for a student who is just hearing about machine learning for the first time. I want to show them that this technology is not just for Silicon Valley, it is for us, too.
This program would give me the tools, network, and platform to advocate for PyTorch meaningfully, build a stronger AI community in my region and beyond,  creating pathways for others to explore and contribute to this field. I am passionate, willing to learn, and deeply committed to making sure no one is left behind as this technology shapes the future..
