# 🧑‍⚖️ Reviewer Guide: PyTorch Ambassador Program

Welcome, and thank you for helping review nominations for the PyTorch Ambassador Program! 🎉

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to review nominations using our score-based ranking system.

---

## 📌 Overview

When someone is nominated to become a PyTorch Ambassador, we ask reviewers to evaluate their application and **submit a score from 1 to 5**. Once all reviewers have submitted scores, the system will automatically **calculate the average** and determine whether the nominee is **approved or rejected**.

---

## 📥 Step 1: Identify New Nominations

You can find open nominations under the Issues tab:  
👉 https://github.com/pytorch-fdn/foundation-initiative/issues

Each nomination issue will have the label:  
- `nomination`  
- `pending-review`  
- `ambassador`  

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Review the Nomination

Carefully read the information provided in the issue, including:  
- Nominee’s contributions to PyTorch  
- Plans for future engagement  
- Additional materials (GitHub profile, links, etc.)

---

## 🧮 Step 3: Submit Your Score

Comment directly on the issue with a line in this format:

```
Score: X
```

Where `X` is your score (from 1 to 5):

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Poor — nominee is not ready |
| 2 | Below average — needs more experience |
| 3 | Average — meets expectations |
| 4 | Good — strong candidate |
| 5 | Excellent — exceptional fit |

✅ **Only your first score comment will be counted.**  
✅ **The score comment is not case-sensitive.** (`score: 4` or `SCORE: 4` both work)

---

## 📊 Step 4: How the Decision Is Made

Once reviewers have submitted their scores, the system will:
1. Collect all `Score: X` comments
2. Calculate the **average score**
3. Automatically apply a label:

| Average Score | Final Status |
|---------------|--------------|
| ≥ 3.0 | ✅ Approved |
| < 3.0 | ❌ Rejected |

An automatic comment will appear with the summary:
- Average score
- List of reviewers
- Final decision

---

## 🧼 Step 5: That’s It!

Once the system decides:
- If approved → The issue is labeled `approved` and onboarding begins
- If rejected → The issue is labeled `rejected` and closed with feedback

---

## 💡 Example Comments

Here’s a valid comment:

```
Score: 4
Shows strong involvement with community projects and mentoring.
```

This is **not valid** and will be ignored:

```
My rating is 5/5
```
