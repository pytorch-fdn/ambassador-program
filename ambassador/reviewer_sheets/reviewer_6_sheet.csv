I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in machine learning and a strong academic background in AI and computer vision. As AI Tech Lead at Awana, I mentor a team that delivers ML solutions for U.S.-based clients while also leading the AI Skills Accelerator, a program I designed to empower Latin American developers with practical, end-to-end ML training.
I have strong expertise in PyTorch for deep learning, computer vision, and geospatial AI. At Awana, I lead and teach modules on Deep Learning, Foundation Models, and Generative AI, all built using PyTorch as the core framework. I’ve worked on real-world projects that apply PyTorch to tasks such as satellite imagery analysis using TorchGeo, transfer learning, and model optimization for production.
My teaching efforts through the AI Skills Accelerator have helped  Latin American developers gain practical experience with PyTorch. I’m deeply passionate about making advanced AI education accessible, especially for underrepresented groups, and PyTorch plays a central role in that mission.

As the Gitkraken Ambassador, only AWS cloud club captain, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador and Co-organizer of Machine Learning, AI, NLP and Deep Learing Community Bangladesh (previously TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh part of Google AI Community), Azure Tech Group Bangladesh, Fabric User Community Bangladesh, The AI, ML Community(part of Global AI Community)  When I started community work I saw so many students get enthusiasm when I share them the oppotunities I got from program but many students are not wiling to work for it due to their academics pressure.  So I was the only person here who had to step up and don't give up on this community building process and I did that and grew over 50,000 members on different facebook tech communities sharing opporunities and growth to them: https://www.facebook.com/azaynul123/ When I joined the Google AI community group TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh as organizer there weren't so much activity but after joining this community we were able to win grandmaster award 2 times and it was first time for Bangladeshi community to have taken 92+ events in a single year. We also organized ML Olympiad 2023, 2024 , Keras Community Day 2023 physically in Brac University, 3 of our community members also won global awards from google for taking highest events: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zaynul-abedin-miah_vertexai-google-machinelearning-activity-7292131729782280192-8rRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACJvR6sBLMfFJjZ96ahnmku97wrMGgU6eIM . I was the only person in Bangladesh got featured 4 times by Google: June: https://lnkd.in/g6W5FVJv ,

Also I took ml paper reading club session recently one by myself and other with supervisor on her research paper which is titled:  Video Analytics for Activity Profiling, Fall & Unstable Motion Detection and it got massive response on Facebook within 2 days it got 2.7K views and after this event many student started doing research work under her supervision: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHGDyeOCXVQfDHoouVp7YF_LEbdjh8JGz&si=A7xqiG55myR6HjIE ,  https://www.facebook.com/bdaiml .

In addition to my teaching and community involvement, I actively conduct research using PyTorch. Most recently, I submitted a research paper addressing bias and fairness challenges in federated learning, specifically applied to the healthcare sector. The work leverages PyTorch to implement distributed model training with fairness-aware optimization strategies, showcasing how the framework can be used to tackle critical real-world issues in sensitive domains like healthcare. This further reflects my commitment to applying PyTorch not just for performance, but also for ethical and responsible AI.

In 2024, I organized and delivered the [Oxford Human-centred AI Design Bootcamp](https://www.hcaibootcamp.site) where multiple stakeholders took part in training and designing AI/ML solutions. I intend to organize further such events in partnership with the PyTorch Foundation in my role as PyTorch Ambassador. The goal of the bootcamp events is to train participants on AI/ML and design innovation methods to empower them to co-design solutions for real-world challenges. This role will help me utilize the support from the Foundation to bring PyTorch to the community of practice in the healthcare field. Thank you for the opportunity.
