I've been writing blogs and conducting educational cohorts for ~5 years now. It was in 2020 that I along with some passionate folks started ""Build With Us"" Cohorts at Crework. Here we chose a small set of peers divide them into teams and helped them build real-world products rather than simple PoC projects. We had weekly reading and implementation sessions on various topics revolving around various topics but implementations centering around PyTorch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I am not yet a PyTorch expert or an active contributor to the framework, I see this opportunity as a powerful step forward, not just for me, but for my entire community. In many parts of Nigeria and across Africa, access to hands-on support and mentorship in artificial intelligence and machine learning is still very limited. I want to change that.
Becoming a PyTorch Ambassador would give me the chance to learn more deeply, grow my skills, and bring that knowledge home in ways that make a real difference. I want to be the person who sparks that first âahaâ moment for a student who is just hearing about machine learning for the first time. I want to show them that this technology is not just for Silicon Valley, it is for us, too.
This program would give me the tools, network, and platform to advocate for PyTorch meaningfully, build a stronger AI community in my region and beyond,  creating pathways for others to explore and contribute to this field. I am passionate, willing to learn, and deeply committed to making sure no one is left behind as this technology shapes the future..
