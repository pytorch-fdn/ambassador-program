I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in machine learning and a strong academic background in AI and computer vision. As AI Tech Lead at Awana, I mentor a team that delivers ML solutions for U.S.-based clients while also leading the AI Skills Accelerator, a program I designed to empower Latin American developers with practical, end-to-end ML training.
I have strong expertise in PyTorch for deep learning, computer vision, and geospatial AI. At Awana, I lead and teach modules on Deep Learning, Foundation Models, and Generative AI, all built using PyTorch as the core framework. I’ve worked on real-world projects that apply PyTorch to tasks such as satellite imagery analysis using TorchGeo, transfer learning, and model optimization for production.
My teaching efforts through the AI Skills Accelerator have helped  Latin American developers gain practical experience with PyTorch. I’m deeply passionate about making advanced AI education accessible, especially for underrepresented groups, and PyTorch plays a central role in that mission.

Yo, the nominee is no stranger to hustle and leadership! They rocked it as an Unstop Ambassador, where they turned networking into an art form, and slayed as the Machine Learning Co-Lead at GDG, running squads and leveling up the ML game for the community. They didn’t stop there—picked as a DEV3PACK Fellow and an ML Fellow at Fellowship.ai, proving they don’t just talk AI, they live and breathe it. Plus, they’ve crushed multiple internships, stacking real-world experience like boss moves in their coding playbook. With this mix of street cred and deep tech chops, they’re ready to blaze trails as a PyTorch Ambassador, bringing the vibes, the skills, and the mad passion to keep the community lit and learning nonstop.

As a PyTorch Ambassador, I would actively promote the adoption and effective use of PyTorch within my academic, professional, and online communities. Drawing from my background as a university lecturer and content creator, I would contribute in the following ways:
	1.	Community Education and Engagement
I plan to organize regular workshops, webinars, and hands-on labs on PyTorch fundamentals, deep learning, and generative AI applications. These events will be tailored for students, researchers, and developers, especially in underrepresented regions like East Africa, to help them build practical skills using PyTorch.
	2.	Content Creation and Localization
I will create high-quality educational content—tutorials, videos, blog posts, and code walkthroughs—focusing on real-world use cases of PyTorch. Where relevant, I’ll localize this content into regional languages to broaden accessibility and engagement.
	3.	Mentorship and Collaboration
I will mentor aspiring ML practitioners through bootcamps and open-source contribution initiatives, encouraging them to use and contribute to the PyTorch ecosystem. I’ll also foster collaborations between academia and industry by showcasing PyTorch-powered projects and research.
	4.	Advocacy and Representation
I will represent PyTorch at conferences, AI community meetups, and educational panels, advocating for ethical, inclusive, and impactful AI development using PyTorch. I’m committed to bridging the knowledge gap in AI education and showcasing PyTorch as a powerful and approachable framework for learners at all levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve been actively driving AMD’s AI software ecosystem by building open-source community collaborations with vLLM, SGLang, Unsloth, and OpenManus—especially in the context of open-source AI and inference optimization. I’ve initiated developer-facing programs such as GPU contests, hackathons, and technical blog series to deepen engagement and showcase AMD’s leadership in AI acceleration. These efforts reflect my commitment to empowering developers and advancing open innovation across the region. With above, I hope to work more on the PyTorch community. As an existing member of Linux Foundation, AMD is moving forward delivering more on open source AI. This will be the right time to show how AMD technology helps changing this world with its powerful chips, processors and most importantly software ecosystem.

In 2024, I organized and delivered the [Oxford Human-centred AI Design Bootcamp](https://www.hcaibootcamp.site) where multiple stakeholders took part in training and designing AI/ML solutions. I intend to organize further such events in partnership with the PyTorch Foundation in my role as PyTorch Ambassador. The goal of the bootcamp events is to train participants on AI/ML and design innovation methods to empower them to co-design solutions for real-world challenges. This role will help me utilize the support from the Foundation to bring PyTorch to the community of practice in the healthcare field. Thank you for the opportunity.

As a university student in my final year and an intern in machine learning at Synapse AI Labs, my experience with PyTorch has been truly transformative. It’s the device I depend on every day, and it has turned into a crucial aspect of my educational and career life. My enthusiasm for machine learning goes beyond my individual projects; I experience great delight in imparting this knowledge to others, particularly in my position as an instructor at my university. As I assist junior students with their machine learning modules, I've witnessed how even minimal support can ignite a lasting passion for the subject.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve published a research paper with Elsevier on a computer vision-based machine learning model for nutrition detection, built using PyTorch as the core framework. Beyond academics, I co-manage a Facebook group called RNN (RUET Neural Network) for our university, where I regularly engage with peers and juniors interested in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. On the professional side, I’m currently working with an AI startup where I'm developing a Bangla transcription model—again using PyTorch. Whether it's research, community building, or real-world product development, PyTorch has been like the horse of my journey.

- We have 1,500+ members on Meetup.com.
- Our events regularly attract 150+ attendees, including ML engineers, research engineers, and startup founders.
- We’ve had speakers from the core PyTorch team, including Vincent Moens, Mario Lezcano Casado, and Nicolas Hug.
- We consistently receive positive feedback from our attendees (meetup feedback is 4.5 stars on average on meetup.com)
- You can learn more about us here:
