My coding journey began at 12 with basic scripting. At 17, I competed in the Greek Mindstorms Robotics Competition with my school, which sparked my love for programming and problem-solving. Around the same time, I became fascinated by quantum physics, which led me to explore quantum computing — and thus, Python.",,,,,,,,

Fraîchement diplômé d'un Master 2 en systèmes intelligents, je réalise actuellement un stage où j'approfondis mes compétences en PyTorch, notamment pour des applications en réseaux de neurones spiking (SNN) et IA neuromorphique. Mon parcours académique au Vietnam et mes recherches actuelles m'ont permis d'acquérir une expertise pointue dans l'implémentation et l'optimisation de modèles bio-inspirés. Fort de cette expérience, je souhaite mettre à profit mes connaissances pour animer la communauté PyTorch l à travers des ateliers pratiques et des retours d'expérience sur ces architectures innovantes.

Yo, the nominee is no stranger to hustle and leadership! They rocked it as an Unstop Ambassador, where they turned networking into an art form, and slayed as the Machine Learning Co-Lead at GDG, running squads and leveling up the ML game for the community. They didn’t stop there—picked as a DEV3PACK Fellow and an ML Fellow at Fellowship.ai, proving they don’t just talk AI, they live and breathe it. Plus, they’ve crushed multiple internships, stacking real-world experience like boss moves in their coding playbook. With this mix of street cred and deep tech chops, they’re ready to blaze trails as a PyTorch Ambassador, bringing the vibes, the skills, and the mad passion to keep the community lit and learning nonstop.

I’ve been actively driving AMD’s AI software ecosystem by building open-source community collaborations with vLLM, SGLang, Unsloth, and OpenManus—especially in the context of open-source AI and inference optimization. I’ve initiated developer-facing programs such as GPU contests, hackathons, and technical blog series to deepen engagement and showcase AMD’s leadership in AI acceleration. These efforts reflect my commitment to empowering developers and advancing open innovation across the region. With above, I hope to work more on the PyTorch community. As an existing member of Linux Foundation, AMD is moving forward delivering more on open source AI. This will be the right time to show how AMD technology helps changing this world with its powerful chips, processors and most importantly software ecosystem.

While I am not yet a PyTorch expert or an active contributor to the framework, I see this opportunity as a powerful step forward, not just for me, but for my entire community. In many parts of Nigeria and across Africa, access to hands-on support and mentorship in artificial intelligence and machine learning is still very limited. I want to change that.
Becoming a PyTorch Ambassador would give me the chance to learn more deeply, grow my skills, and bring that knowledge home in ways that make a real difference. I want to be the person who sparks that first “aha” moment for a student who is just hearing about machine learning for the first time. I want to show them that this technology is not just for Silicon Valley, it is for us, too.
This program would give me the tools, network, and platform to advocate for PyTorch meaningfully, build a stronger AI community in my region and beyond,  creating pathways for others to explore and contribute to this field. I am passionate, willing to learn, and deeply committed to making sure no one is left behind as this technology shapes the future..

My name is Fedor Shabashev, I live in London, UK and over the last 3 years I organised and hosted many Pytorch meetups in London. 
- We are the only PyTorch meetup group in London (to the best of my knowledge).
- We have 1,500+ members on Meetup.com.
- Our events regularly attract 150+ attendees, including ML engineers, research engineers, and startup founders.
- We’ve had speakers from the core PyTorch team, including Vincent Moens, Mario Lezcano Casado, and Nicolas Hug.
- We consistently receive positive feedback from our attendees (meetup feedback is 4.5 stars on average on meetup.com)
