My Topmate profile (https://topmate.io/hrudushibu) showcases my mentorship offerings and past tech sessions. I also maintain a growing GitHub presence where I share automation scripts, cloud templates, and plan to expand into PyTorch-based AI deployment projects bridging infrastructure with AI workflows. I’m passionate about helping early-career professionals transition into AI roles from traditional IT backgrounds, and I plan to open-source beginner-friendly labs and guides that combine PyTorch with cloud-native tools like AWS, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

As a PyTorch Ambassador, I would actively promote the adoption and effective use of PyTorch within my academic, professional, and online communities. Drawing from my background as a university lecturer and content creator, I would contribute in the following ways:
	1.	Community Education and Engagement
I plan to organize regular workshops, webinars, and hands-on labs on PyTorch fundamentals, deep learning, and generative AI applications. These events will be tailored for students, researchers, and developers, especially in underrepresented regions like East Africa, to help them build practical skills using PyTorch.
	2.	Content Creation and Localization
I will create high-quality educational content—tutorials, videos, blog posts, and code walkthroughs—focusing on real-world use cases of PyTorch. Where relevant, I’ll localize this content into regional languages to broaden accessibility and engagement.
	3.	Mentorship and Collaboration
I will mentor aspiring ML practitioners through bootcamps and open-source contribution initiatives, encouraging them to use and contribute to the PyTorch ecosystem. I’ll also foster collaborations between academia and industry by showcasing PyTorch-powered projects and research.
	4.	Advocacy and Representation
I will represent PyTorch at conferences, AI community meetups, and educational panels, advocating for ethical, inclusive, and impactful AI development using PyTorch. I’m committed to bridging the knowledge gap in AI education and showcasing PyTorch as a powerful and approachable framework for learners at all levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I intend to organize further such events in partnership with the PyTorch Foundation in my role as PyTorch Ambassador. The goal of the bootcamp events is to train participants on AI/ML and design innovation methods to empower them to co-design solutions for real-world challenges. This role will help me utilize the support from the Foundation to bring PyTorch to the community of practice in the healthcare field. Thank you for the opportunity.
