My coding journey began at 12 with basic scripting. At 17, I competed in the Greek Mindstorms Robotics Competition with my school, which sparked my love for programming and problem-solving. Around the same time, I became fascinated by quantum physics, which led me to explore quantum computing — and thus, Python.",,,,,,,,

In addition to my professional and community work, I actively publish educational content through newsletters such as The Cloud Compass (focused on AWS and cloud best practices) and Queuil (covering emerging tech and AI news). My Topmate profile (https://topmate.io/hrudushibu) showcases my mentorship offerings and past tech sessions. I also maintain a growing GitHub presence where I share automation scripts, cloud templates, and plan to expand into PyTorch-based AI deployment projects bridging infrastructure with AI workflows. I’m passionate about helping early-career professionals transition into AI roles from traditional IT backgrounds, and I plan to open-source beginner-friendly labs and guides that combine PyTorch with cloud-native tools like AWS, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

As a university student in my final year and an intern in machine learning at Synapse AI Labs, my experience with PyTorch has been truly transformative. It’s the device I depend on every day, and it has turned into a crucial aspect of my educational and career life. My enthusiasm for machine learning goes beyond my individual projects; I experience great delight in imparting this knowledge to others, particularly in my position as an instructor at my university. As I assist junior students with their machine learning modules, I've witnessed how even minimal support can ignite a lasting passion for the subject.",,,,,,,,
