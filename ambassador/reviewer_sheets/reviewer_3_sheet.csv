Fraîchement diplômé d'un Master 2 en systèmes intelligents, je réalise actuellement un stage où j'approfondis mes compétences en PyTorch, notamment pour des applications en réseaux de neurones spiking (SNN) et IA neuromorphique. Mon parcours académique au Vietnam et mes recherches actuelles m'ont permis d'acquérir une expertise pointue dans l'implémentation et l'optimisation de modèles bio-inspirés. Fort de cette expérience, je souhaite mettre à profit mes connaissances pour animer la communauté PyTorch l à travers des ateliers pratiques et des retours d'expérience sur ces architectures innovantes.

In addition to my professional and community work, I actively publish educational content through newsletters such as The Cloud Compass (focused on AWS and cloud best practices) and Queuil (covering emerging tech and AI news). My Topmate profile (https://topmate.io/hrudushibu) showcases my mentorship offerings and past tech sessions. I also maintain a growing GitHub presence where I share automation scripts, cloud templates, and plan to expand into PyTorch-based AI deployment projects bridging infrastructure with AI workflows. I’m passionate about helping early-career professionals transition into AI roles from traditional IT backgrounds, and I plan to open-source beginner-friendly labs and guides that combine PyTorch with cloud-native tools like AWS, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

While I am not yet a PyTorch expert or an active contributor to the framework, I see this opportunity as a powerful step forward, not just for me, but for my entire community. In many parts of Nigeria and across Africa, access to hands-on support and mentorship in artificial intelligence and machine learning is still very limited. I want to change that.
Becoming a PyTorch Ambassador would give me the chance to learn more deeply, grow my skills, and bring that knowledge home in ways that make a real difference. I want to be the person who sparks that first “aha” moment for a student who is just hearing about machine learning for the first time. I want to show them that this technology is not just for Silicon Valley, it is for us, too.
This program would give me the tools, network, and platform to advocate for PyTorch meaningfully, build a stronger AI community in my region and beyond,  creating pathways for others to explore and contribute to this field. I am passionate, willing to learn, and deeply committed to making sure no one is left behind as this technology shapes the future..
