I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in machine learning and a strong academic background in AI and computer vision. As AI Tech Lead at Awana, I mentor a team that delivers ML solutions for U.S.-based clients while also leading the AI Skills Accelerator, a program I designed to empower Latin American developers with practical, end-to-end ML training.
I have strong expertise in PyTorch for deep learning, computer vision, and geospatial AI. At Awana, I lead and teach modules on Deep Learning, Foundation Models, and Generative AI, all built using PyTorch as the core framework. I’ve worked on real-world projects that apply PyTorch to tasks such as satellite imagery analysis using TorchGeo, transfer learning, and model optimization for production.
My teaching efforts through the AI Skills Accelerator have helped  Latin American developers gain practical experience with PyTorch. I’m deeply passionate about making advanced AI education accessible, especially for underrepresented groups, and PyTorch plays a central role in that mission.

I am currently in the process of joining the NVIDIA University Ambassador Program, which I see as a strong complement to the PyTorch Ambassador role. Together, these programs would position me to deliver high-impact training on how to effectively use PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs—particularly for large-scale deep learning applications such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. Additionally, as a certified Instructor with The Carpentries, I have the ability to teach these topics to a global audience through workshops and academic courses. This combination of technical expertise, outreach platforms, and pedagogical training would enable me to promote PyTorch in a variety of educational and research settings, both locally and internationally.

I’ve published a research paper with Elsevier on a computer vision-based machine learning model for nutrition detection, built using PyTorch as the core framework. Beyond academics, I co-manage a Facebook group called RNN (RUET Neural Network) for our university, where I regularly engage with peers and juniors interested in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. On the professional side, I’m currently working with an AI startup where I'm developing a Bangla transcription model—again using PyTorch. Whether it's research, community building, or real-world product development, PyTorch has been like the horse of my journey.

My name is Fedor Shabashev, I live in London, UK and over the last 3 years I organised and hosted many Pytorch meetups in London. 
- We are the only PyTorch meetup group in London (to the best of my knowledge).
- We have 1,500+ members on Meetup.com.
- Our events regularly attract 150+ attendees, including ML engineers, research engineers, and startup founders.
- We’ve had speakers from the core PyTorch team, including Vincent Moens, Mario Lezcano Casado, and Nicolas Hug.
- We consistently receive positive feedback from our attendees (meetup feedback is 4.5 stars on average on meetup.com)
- You can learn more about us here:
