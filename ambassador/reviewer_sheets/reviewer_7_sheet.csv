My coding journey began at 12 with basic scripting. At 17, I competed in the Greek Mindstorms Robotics Competition with my school, which sparked my love for programming and problem-solving. Around the same time, I became fascinated by quantum physics, which led me to explore quantum computing — and thus, Python.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the Gitkraken Ambassador, only AWS cloud club captain, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador and Co-organizer of Machine Learning, AI, NLP and Deep Learing Community Bangladesh (previously TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh part of Google AI Community), Azure Tech Group Bangladesh, Fabric User Community Bangladesh, The AI, ML Community(part of Global AI Community)  When I started community work I saw so many students get enthusiasm when I share them the oppotunities I got from program but many students are not wiling to work for it due to their academics pressure.  So I was the only person here who had to step up and don't give up on this community building process and I did that and grew over 50,000 members on different facebook tech communities sharing opporunities and growth to them: https://www.facebook.com/azaynul123/ When I joined the Google AI community group TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh as organizer there weren't so much activity but after joining this community we were able to win grandmaster award 2 times and it was first time for Bangladeshi community to have taken 92+ events in a single year. We also organized ML Olympiad 2023, 2024 , Keras Community Day 2023 physically in Brac University, 3 of our community members also won global awards from google for taking highest events: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zaynul-abedin-miah_vertexai-google-machinelearning-activity-7292131729782280192-8rRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACJvR6sBLMfFJjZ96ahnmku97wrMGgU6eIM . I was the only person in Bangladesh got featured 4 times by Google: June: https://lnkd.in/g6W5FVJv ,

Also I took ml paper reading club session recently one by myself and other with supervisor on her research paper which is titled:  Video Analytics for Activity Profiling, Fall & Unstable Motion Detection and it got massive response on Facebook within 2 days it got 2.7K views and after this event many student started doing research work under her supervision: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHGDyeOCXVQfDHoouVp7YF_LEbdjh8JGz&si=A7xqiG55myR6HjIE ,  https://www.facebook.com/bdaiml .

As a university student in my final year and an intern in machine learning at Synapse AI Labs, my experience with PyTorch has been truly transformative. It’s the device I depend on every day, and it has turned into a crucial aspect of my educational and career life. My enthusiasm for machine learning goes beyond my individual projects; I experience great delight in imparting this knowledge to others, particularly in my position as an instructor at my university. As I assist junior students with their machine learning modules, I've witnessed how even minimal support can ignite a lasting passion for the subject.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve published a research paper with Elsevier on a computer vision-based machine learning model for nutrition detection, built using PyTorch as the core framework. Beyond academics, I co-manage a Facebook group called RNN (RUET Neural Network) for our university, where I regularly engage with peers and juniors interested in AI, machine learning, and deep learning. On the professional side, I’m currently working with an AI startup where I'm developing a Bangla transcription model—again using PyTorch. Whether it's research, community building, or real-world product development, PyTorch has been like the horse of my journey.
