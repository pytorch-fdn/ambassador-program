As the Gitkraken Ambassador, only AWS cloud club captain, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador and Co-organizer of Machine Learning, AI, NLP and Deep Learing Community Bangladesh (previously TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh part of Google AI Community), Azure Tech Group Bangladesh, Fabric User Community Bangladesh, The AI, ML Community(part of Global AI Community)  When I started community work I saw so many students get enthusiasm when I share them the oppotunities I got from program but many students are not wiling to work for it due to their academics pressure.  So I was the only person here who had to step up and don't give up on this community building process and I did that and grew over 50,000 members on different facebook tech communities sharing opporunities and growth to them: https://www.facebook.com/azaynul123/ When I joined the Google AI community group TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh as organizer there weren't so much activity but after joining this community we were able to win grandmaster award 2 times and it was first time for Bangladeshi community to have taken 92+ events in a single year. We also organized ML Olympiad 2023, 2024 , Keras Community Day 2023 physically in Brac University, 3 of our community members also won global awards from google for taking highest events: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zaynul-abedin-miah_vertexai-google-machinelearning-activity-7292131729782280192-8rRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACJvR6sBLMfFJjZ96ahnmku97wrMGgU6eIM . I was the only person in Bangladesh got featured 4 times by Google: June: https://lnkd.in/g6W5FVJv ,

Also I took ml paper reading club session recently one by myself and other with supervisor on her research paper which is titled:  Video Analytics for Activity Profiling, Fall & Unstable Motion Detection and it got massive response on Facebook within 2 days it got 2.7K views and after this event many student started doing research work under her supervision: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHGDyeOCXVQfDHoouVp7YF_LEbdjh8JGz&si=A7xqiG55myR6HjIE ,  https://www.facebook.com/bdaiml .

Yo, the nominee is no stranger to hustle and leadership! They rocked it as an Unstop Ambassador, where they turned networking into an art form, and slayed as the Machine Learning Co-Lead at GDG, running squads and leveling up the ML game for the community. They didn’t stop there—picked as a DEV3PACK Fellow and an ML Fellow at Fellowship.ai, proving they don’t just talk AI, they live and breathe it. Plus, they’ve crushed multiple internships, stacking real-world experience like boss moves in their coding playbook. With this mix of street cred and deep tech chops, they’re ready to blaze trails as a PyTorch Ambassador, bringing the vibes, the skills, and the mad passion to keep the community lit and learning nonstop.

Here's my personal linkedIn page:https://www.linkedin.com/in/bingqing-guo-ai/ 
I’ve been actively driving AMD’s AI software ecosystem by building open-source community collaborations with vLLM, SGLang, Unsloth, and OpenManus—especially in the context of open-source AI and inference optimization. I’ve initiated developer-facing programs such as GPU contests, hackathons, and technical blog series to deepen engagement and showcase AMD’s leadership in AI acceleration. These efforts reflect my commitment to empowering developers and advancing open innovation across the region. With above, I hope to work more on the PyTorch community. As an existing member of Linux Foundation, AMD is moving forward delivering more on open source AI. This will be the right time to show how AMD technology helps changing this world with its powerful chips, processors and most importantly software ecosystem.

In 2024, I organized and delivered the [Oxford Human-centred AI Design Bootcamp](https://www.hcaibootcamp.site) where multiple stakeholders took part in training and designing AI/ML solutions. I intend to organize further such events in partnership with the PyTorch Foundation in my role as PyTorch Ambassador. The goal of the bootcamp events is to train participants on AI/ML and design innovation methods to empower them to co-design solutions for real-world challenges. This role will help me utilize the support from the Foundation to bring PyTorch to the community of practice in the healthcare field. Thank you for the opportunity.

As a university student in my final year and an intern in machine learning at Synapse AI Labs, my experience with PyTorch has been truly transformative. It’s the device I depend on every day, and it has turned into a crucial aspect of my educational and career life. My enthusiasm for machine learning goes beyond my individual projects; I experience great delight in imparting this knowledge to others, particularly in my position as an instructor at my university. As I assist junior students with their machine learning modules, I've witnessed how even minimal support can ignite a lasting passion for the subject.",,,,,,,,
