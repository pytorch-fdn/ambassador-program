My coding journey began at 12 with basic scripting. At 17, I competed in the Greek Mindstorms Robotics Competition with my school, which sparked my love for programming and problem-solving. Around the same time, I became fascinated by quantum physics, which led me to explore quantum computing — and thus, Python.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fraîchement diplômé d'un Master 2 en systèmes intelligents, je réalise actuellement un stage où j'approfondis mes compétences en PyTorch, notamment pour des applications en réseaux de neurones spiking (SNN) et IA neuromorphique. Mon parcours académique au Vietnam et mes recherches actuelles m'ont permis d'acquérir une expertise pointue dans l'implémentation et l'optimisation de modèles bio-inspirés. Fort de cette expérience, je souhaite mettre à profit mes connaissances pour animer la communauté PyTorch l à travers des ateliers pratiques et des retours d'expérience sur ces architectures innovantes.

Yo, the nominee is no stranger to hustle and leadership! They rocked it as an Unstop Ambassador, where they turned networking into an art form, and slayed as the Machine Learning Co-Lead at GDG, running squads and leveling up the ML game for the community. They didn’t stop there—picked as a DEV3PACK Fellow and an ML Fellow at Fellowship.ai, proving they don’t just talk AI, they live and breathe it. Plus, they’ve crushed multiple internships, stacking real-world experience like boss moves in their coding playbook. With this mix of street cred and deep tech chops, they’re ready to blaze trails as a PyTorch Ambassador, bringing the vibes, the skills, and the mad passion to keep the community lit and learning nonstop.

I’ve been actively driving AMD’s AI software ecosystem by building open-source community collaborations with vLLM, SGLang, Unsloth, and OpenManus—especially in the context of open-source AI and inference optimization. I’ve initiated developer-facing programs such as GPU contests, hackathons, and technical blog series to deepen engagement and showcase AMD’s leadership in AI acceleration. These efforts reflect my commitment to empowering developers and advancing open innovation across the region. With above, I hope to work more on the PyTorch community. As an existing member of Linux Foundation, AMD is moving forward delivering more on open source AI. This will be the right time to show how AMD technology helps changing this world with its powerful chips, processors and most importantly software ecosystem.

I am currently in the process of joining the NVIDIA University Ambassador Program, which I see as a strong complement to the PyTorch Ambassador role. Together, these programs would position me to deliver high-impact training on how to effectively use PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs—particularly for large-scale deep learning applications such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. Additionally, as a certified Instructor with The Carpentries, I have the ability to teach these topics to a global audience through workshops and academic courses. This combination of technical expertise, outreach platforms, and pedagogical training would enable me to promote PyTorch in a variety of educational and research settings, both locally and internationally.
