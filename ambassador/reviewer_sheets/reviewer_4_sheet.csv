My coding journey began at 12 with basic scripting. At 17, I competed in the Greek Mindstorms Robotics Competition with my school, which sparked my love for programming and problem-solving. Around the same time, I became fascinated by quantum physics, which led me to explore quantum computing — and thus, Python.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As the Gitkraken Ambassador, only AWS cloud club captain, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador and Co-organizer of Machine Learning, AI, NLP and Deep Learing Community Bangladesh (previously TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh part of Google AI Community), Azure Tech Group Bangladesh, Fabric User Community Bangladesh, The AI, ML Community(part of Global AI Community)  When I started community work I saw so many students get enthusiasm when I share them the oppotunities I got from program but many students are not wiling to work for it due to their academics pressure.  So I was the only person here who had to step up and don't give up on this community building process and I did that and grew over 50,000 members on different facebook tech communities sharing opporunities and growth to them: https://www.facebook.com/azaynul123/ When I joined the Google AI community group TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh as organizer there weren't so much activity but after joining this community we were able to win grandmaster award 2 times and it was first time for Bangladeshi community to have taken 92+ events in a single year. We also organized ML Olympiad 2023, 2024 , Keras Community Day 2023 physically in Brac University, 3 of our community members also won global awards from google for taking highest events: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zaynul-abedin-miah_vertexai-google-machinelearning-activity-7292131729782280192-8rRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACJvR6sBLMfFJjZ96ahnmku97wrMGgU6eIM .

I’ve been actively driving AMD’s AI software ecosystem by building open-source community collaborations with vLLM, SGLang, Unsloth, and OpenManus—especially in the context of open-source AI and inference optimization. I’ve initiated developer-facing programs such as GPU contests, hackathons, and technical blog series to deepen engagement and showcase AMD’s leadership in AI acceleration. These efforts reflect my commitment to empowering developers and advancing open innovation across the region. With above, I hope to work more on the PyTorch community. As an existing member of Linux Foundation, AMD is moving forward delivering more on open source AI. This will be the right time to show how AMD technology helps changing this world with its powerful chips, processors and most importantly software ecosystem.
