As the Gitkraken Ambassador, only AWS cloud club captain, Microsoft Learn Gold Student Ambassador and Co-organizer of Machine Learning, AI, NLP and Deep Learing Community Bangladesh (previously TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh part of Google AI Community), Azure Tech Group Bangladesh, Fabric User Community Bangladesh, The AI, ML Community(part of Global AI Community)  When I started community work I saw so many students get enthusiasm when I share them the oppotunities I got from program but many students are not wiling to work for it due to their academics pressure.  So I was the only person here who had to step up and don't give up on this community building process and I did that and grew over 50,000 members on different facebook tech communities sharing opporunities and growth to them: https://www.facebook.com/azaynul123/ When I joined the Google AI community group TensorFlow User Group Bangladesh as organizer there weren't so much activity but after joining this community we were able to win grandmaster award 2 times and it was first time for Bangladeshi community to have taken 92+ events in a single year. We also organized ML Olympiad 2023, 2024 , Keras Community Day 2023 physically in Brac University, 3 of our community members also won global awards from google for taking highest events: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zaynul-abedin-miah_vertexai-google-machinelearning-activity-7292131729782280192-8rRc?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAACJvR6sBLMfFJjZ96ahnmku97wrMGgU6eIM .

Also I took ml paper reading club session recently one by myself and other with supervisor on her research paper which is titled:  Video Analytics for Activity Profiling, Fall & Unstable Motion Detection and it got massive response on Facebook within 2 days it got 2.7K views and after this event many student started doing research work under her supervision: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHGDyeOCXVQfDHoouVp7YF_LEbdjh8JGz&si=A7xqiG55myR6HjIE ,  https://www.facebook.com/bdaiml .

In addition to my professional and community work, I actively publish educational content through newsletters such as The Cloud Compass (focused on AWS and cloud best practices) and Queuil (covering emerging tech and AI news). My Topmate profile (https://topmate.io/hrudushibu) showcases my mentorship offerings and past tech sessions. I also maintain a growing GitHub presence where I share automation scripts, cloud templates, and plan to expand into PyTorch-based AI deployment projects bridging infrastructure with AI workflows. I’m passionate about helping early-career professionals transition into AI roles from traditional IT backgrounds, and I plan to open-source beginner-friendly labs and guides that combine PyTorch with cloud-native tools like AWS, GitHub Actions, and Docker.

I am currently in the process of joining the NVIDIA University Ambassador Program, which I see as a strong complement to the PyTorch Ambassador role. Together, these programs would position me to deliver high-impact training on how to effectively use PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs—particularly for large-scale deep learning applications such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. Additionally, as a certified Instructor with The Carpentries, I have the ability to teach these topics to a global audience through workshops and academic courses. This combination of technical expertise, outreach platforms, and pedagogical training would enable me to promote PyTorch in a variety of educational and research settings, both locally and internationally.

In addition to my teaching and community involvement, I actively conduct research using PyTorch. Most recently, I submitted a research paper addressing bias and fairness challenges in federated learning, specifically applied to the healthcare sector. The work leverages PyTorch to implement distributed model training with fairness-aware optimization strategies, showcasing how the framework can be used to tackle critical real-world issues in sensitive domains like healthcare. This further reflects my commitment to applying PyTorch not just for performance, but also for ethical and responsible AI.
