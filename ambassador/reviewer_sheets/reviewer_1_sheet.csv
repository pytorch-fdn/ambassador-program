As a PyTorch Ambassador, I would actively promote the adoption and effective use of PyTorch within my academic, professional, and online communities. Drawing from my background as a university lecturer and content creator, I would contribute in the following ways:
	1.	Community Education and Engagement
I plan to organize regular workshops, webinars, and hands-on labs on PyTorch fundamentals, deep learning, and generative AI applications. These events will be tailored for students, researchers, and developers, especially in underrepresented regions like East Africa, to help them build practical skills using PyTorch.
	2.	Content Creation and Localization
I will create high-quality educational content—tutorials, videos, blog posts, and code walkthroughs—focusing on real-world use cases of PyTorch. Where relevant, I’ll localize this content into regional languages to broaden accessibility and engagement.
	3.	Mentorship and Collaboration
I will mentor aspiring ML practitioners through bootcamps and open-source contribution initiatives, encouraging them to use and contribute to the PyTorch ecosystem. I’ll also foster collaborations between academia and industry by showcasing PyTorch-powered projects and research.
	4.	Advocacy and Representation
I will represent PyTorch at conferences, AI community meetups, and educational panels, advocating for ethical, inclusive, and impactful AI development using PyTorch. I’m committed to bridging the knowledge gap in AI education and showcasing PyTorch as a powerful and approachable framework for learners at all levels.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While I am not yet a PyTorch expert or an active contributor to the framework, I see this opportunity as a powerful step forward, not just for me, but for my entire community. In many parts of Nigeria and across Africa, access to hands-on support and mentorship in artificial intelligence and machine learning is still very limited. I want to change that.
Becoming a PyTorch Ambassador would give me the chance to learn more deeply, grow my skills, and bring that knowledge home in ways that make a real difference. I want to be the person who sparks that first “aha” moment for a student who is just hearing about machine learning for the first time. I want to show them that this technology is not just for Silicon Valley, it is for us, too.
This program would give me the tools, network, and platform to advocate for PyTorch meaningfully, build a stronger AI community in my region and beyond,  creating pathways for others to explore and contribute to this field. I am passionate, willing to learn, and deeply committed to making sure no one is left behind as this technology shapes the future..
