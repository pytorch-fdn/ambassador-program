As a PyTorch Ambassador, I would actively promote the adoption and effective use of PyTorch within my academic, professional, and online communities. Drawing from my background as a university lecturer and content creator, I would contribute in the following ways:
	1.	Community Education and Engagement
I plan to organize regular workshops, webinars, and hands-on labs on PyTorch fundamentals, deep learning, and generative AI applications. These events will be tailored for students, researchers, and developers, especially in underrepresented regions like East Africa, to help them build practical skills using PyTorch.
	2.	Content Creation and Localization
I will create high-quality educational content—tutorials, videos, blog posts, and code walkthroughs—focusing on real-world use cases of PyTorch. Where relevant, I’ll localize this content into regional languages to broaden accessibility and engagement.
	3.	Mentorship and Collaboration
I will mentor aspiring ML practitioners through bootcamps and open-source contribution initiatives, encouraging them to use and contribute to the PyTorch ecosystem. I’ll also foster collaborations between academia and industry by showcasing PyTorch-powered projects and research.
	4.	Advocacy and Representation
I will represent PyTorch at conferences, AI community meetups, and educational panels, advocating for ethical, inclusive, and impactful AI development using PyTorch. I’m committed to bridging the knowledge gap in AI education and showcasing PyTorch as a powerful and approachable framework for learners at all levels.",,,,,,,,

I am currently in the process of joining the NVIDIA University Ambassador Program, which I see as a strong complement to the PyTorch Ambassador role. Together, these programs would position me to deliver high-impact training on how to effectively use PyTorch on NVIDIA GPUs—particularly for large-scale deep learning applications such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. Additionally, as a certified Instructor with The Carpentries, I have the ability to teach these topics to a global audience through workshops and academic courses. This combination of technical expertise, outreach platforms, and pedagogical training would enable me to promote PyTorch in a variety of educational and research settings, both locally and internationally.

The goal of the bootcamp events is to train participants on AI/ML and design innovation methods to empower them to co-design solutions for real-world challenges. This role will help me utilize the support from the Foundation to bring PyTorch to the community of practice in the healthcare field. Thank you for the opportunity.
