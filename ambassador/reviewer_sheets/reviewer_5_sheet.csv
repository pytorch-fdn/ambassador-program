```markdown
I bring over a decade of hands-on experience in machine learning and a strong academic background in AI and computer vision. As AI Tech Lead at Awana, I mentor a team that delivers ML solutions for U.S.-based clients while also leading the AI Skills Accelerator, a program I designed to empower Latin American developers with practical, end-to-end ML training.
I have strong expertise in PyTorch for deep learning, computer vision, and geospatial AI. At Awana, I lead and teach modules on Deep Learning, Foundation Models, and Generative AI, all built using PyTorch as the core framework. I’ve worked on real-world projects that apply PyTorch to tasks such as satellite imagery analysis using TorchGeo, transfer learning, and model optimization for production.
My teaching efforts through the AI Skills Accelerator have helped  Latin American developers gain practical experience with PyTorch. I’m deeply passionate about making advanced AI education accessible, especially for underrepresented groups, and PyTorch plays a central role in that mission.

In addition to my teaching and community involvement, I actively conduct research using PyTorch. Most recently, I submitted a research paper addressing bias and fairness challenges in federated learning, specifically applied to the healthcare sector. The work leverages PyTorch to implement distributed model training with fairness-aware optimization strategies, showcasing how the framework can be used to tackle critical real-world issues in sensitive domains like healthcare. This further reflects my commitment to applying PyTorch not just for performance, but also for ethical and responsible AI.
